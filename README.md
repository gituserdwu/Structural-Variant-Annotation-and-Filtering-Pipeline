# SV Annotation and Filtering Analysis

**Author:** Dongjing Wu

## Overview

SV Annotation and Filtering Analysis Following Gong et al. 2025 Nature Communications ([https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57312-9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57312-9))


Complete workflow from SV VCF to potentially pathogenic SVs using SV VCF and protein-coding genes only.

## Version Notes

**VERSION:** CORRECTED for SVTYPE misclassification bug from [https://github.com/tgong1/StructuralVariantUtil](https://github.com/tgong1/StructuralVariantUtil)

## Description

This repository implements the structural variant annotation and filtering analysis pipeline described in Gong et al. 2025, specifically adapted for chordoma research. The workflow processes SV VCF files to identify potentially pathogenic structural variants affecting protein-coding genes.
